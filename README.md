# NS-3-Simulator

# This code is written to create a Network Simulator for a museum using NS 3 which is written in C++ and Python with scripting capability . For this application assume that a person (you) is visiting a museum.  The application will make available information about the exhibits inside the museum based on the person's location. 

# The application will display the exhibits a person can visit within a radius from his location. The smartphone will be able to identify the location of the paintings inside the museum based on the signal it receives from the access points installed in the building. 

# Additionally, the application will display the distance travelled by  the visitor inside the museum.
